## Christopher O'Donnell

**I am a Senior psychology student attending USF!** I hope to continue my eduction through my Master's and Doctoral Degree studying Clinical Psychology! I specialize in Clinical Psychology, though I have done extensive work within Positive Psychology.

I have worked with [Valerie's House](https://valerieshouse.org) providing grief counseling for children. This was one of the most impactful experiences of my life as I was able to give back to children who were in my position at a young age! 

Along with this, I have experience providing Positive Psychology counseling through USF with elementary school children!
